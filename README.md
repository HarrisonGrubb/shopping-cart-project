### Managing Your Shopping Cart
This project creates a checkout process for my favorite store/resturant, Sheetz.  

## Requirements 
Python 3.7
Anaconda 3.7
Pip

Feel free to fork this project or create your own repo.

You can then download a local version.

Use the commands below to set up your virtual enviroment.

The repo doesn't currently use Pandas or Pytest but in the next few iterations I hope to leverage these additional packages. If you want to install them use the commands below.
```
pip install sendgrid
